# [Deep xVA Solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02633) in TensorFlow (2.0)


## How to run the examples

Currently we offer two examples from the paper. We compute the exposure of:

* A forward on a single underlying.
* A basket call option on 100 underlyings.

To run the examples, simply rung the associated scripts

* forward.py
* basketCall.py

Examples covering Algorithm 3 will be posted soon. We are moving our code from Tensorflow 1.x to Tensorflow 2.2.

## Aknowledgements.
We are grateful to Chang Jiang for the help in the conversion of our code base from Tensorflow 1.x to Tensorflow 2.2.


## Dependencies
